My first Flutter app. I designated that when I was leaning Flutter. 

It is quiz app...

It has 3 pages. 

- First one is entrance page that is in the "main.dart".  You just start the game in that page.

- Second one is Quiz Selection page that is in the "selections.dart". You can choose any type of quiz.(Actually I just created flagquiz page so all buttons directs flagquizpage).

- And the last one is Quiz page that is in the "flagquest.dart". I get my flag images from url.

- Quiz page is getting questions and flag url sources from "flags.dart".

- Quiz page is avaible to use. You can answer the questions. 

- After the quiz finished. App directs you in selection page.

- You can see that how many questions that you answered as a true in selection page.

P.S: I created this app in Turkish language.
